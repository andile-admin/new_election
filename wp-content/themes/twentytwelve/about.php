                            <strong>REASONS WHY YOUTH SHOULD VOTE</strong>
                            <div class="margin-10"></div>
                            ‘Why should I even bother with the elections? My vote doesn’t count, and it’s not like anything will change anyway,’ is what a friend of mine said to me while we were having a discussion about the upcoming elections.<br> 
                            It is election season again in South Africa as the 2014 National and Provincial elections are scheduled to take place, and voter registrations are taking place on the 9th and the 10th of November 2013. I’m pretty sure that my friend is not the only young person who believes that their participation in democracy and choosing the leadership of this country is not necessary and will not make a difference.<br>
                            But in reality, the youth are a powerful social component in this country. According to UNFPA, the youth in South Africa (those who are below the age of 35 years) make up 77.6 percent of the population. This is a significant number of people that can contribute in unison to social change, therefore there’s no doubt that whatever we want to see transformed will come to pass.<br>
                            <div class="margin-10"></div>
                            So why should you, as a young individual, vote in these upcoming elections?
                            <div class="margin-10"></div>
                            <strong>Complacency never changed anything</strong>
                            <div class="margin-10"></div>
                            Complaining about things that are wrong in this country merely gets emotional and heated debates going, and doing nothing to ensure that social change occurs is just as bad.<br> 
                            Too many people sit back and say that somebody else will do things that they should be doing. Being complacent, sitting around and doing nothing except complaining and feeling sorry for yourself makes no contribution to change. You form part of 77.6 percent of the population that can make a difference if complacency flies out the window and is replaced by active participation.<br>
                            <div class="margin-10"></div>
                            <strong>Youth are powerful drivers of change</strong>
                            <div class="margin-10"></div>
                            Do you think that South Africa would have all these freedoms that it has today if the previous generation of youth did nothing to transform the country? Those who marched against apartheid laws pertaining to education were youth. Those who fought against previous injustices were youth.
                            Young people are powerful agents of social change. If 77.6 percent of South Africa’s population merely sits back and does nothing to participate in bettering the country, taking the baton that is passed on to them by the previous generation, nothing will change.<br> 
                            <div class="margin-10"></div>
                            <strong>Youth are accountable to what happens to South Africa</strong>
                            <div class="margin-10"></div>
                            We are the ones who will inherit this country from the current generation of leaders. What are we doing to ensure the betterment of this country?<br>
                            We are as much accountable to how this country is run as the government because once the current body of leaders step down, the country will be in our hands. You should also think about what kind of legacy you want to leave for your kids once you step down from leading this country. What type of South Africa do you want them to inherit?<br>
                            There is no doubt that the youth should be the first group of people running to voting stations to cast their votes and to be the ones in the frontline of active participation in this country. 
                            And if you as a young individual don’t do it, no one will.
